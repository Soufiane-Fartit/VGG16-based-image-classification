# VGG16-based-image-classification

WE USE THE VGG16 IMAGE CLASSIFIER AND MODIFY IT TO OUTPUT 2 CLASSES.
WE THEN RE-TRAIN THE MODEL TO PREDICT WHETHER THE IMAGE IS A DOG OR A CAT.
THIS IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE VGG16 HAS BEEN PRETRAINED ON IMAGENET.

THE CODE IS MADE ON GOOGLE COLAB PLATFORM : colab.research.google.com
